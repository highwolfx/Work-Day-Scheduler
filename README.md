# Work-Day-Scheduler


## Description

This fifth homework assignment was designed to be a task scheduler that allows a user to store their tasks that need to be done throughout the day. It can be used to log tasks that need to be done daily on an hourly time slot. As the time passes during the day, the rows will change color depending on what the time is.


## Installation

Visit the [deployed webpage](https://highwolfx.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/) to view the scheduler online.

## Usage

Deployed webpage can be found [here](https://highwolfx.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/).

The user is greeted with the [task scheduler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/highwolfx/Work-Day-Scheduler/assets/screenshot.png) screen.

</p>

In the orange box, the current time and date is displayed, formatted as hour:minute:seconds AM/PM, and the date as day of the week, day-month-year.

In the red box, the "Clear All Saved Tasks" button clears all the tasks written in the task boxes AND the saved tasks.

In the blue box, the hour of the work day is shown. When the row is grey, that means that the hour has already passed. When the row is red, that is the current hour. When the row is green, that means that the time has not occured yet.

In the green box, the task that wants to be saved can be typed in the corresponding time row. Once the task content has been filled out, the save button of the corresponding row (the button shown in the purple box) should be pressed to save the task to local storage so it can be loaded later on. Once the task has been saved, it will stay even when the page is reloaded, until it is cleared from local storage via the "Clear All Saved Tasks" button, or the local storage has been cleared.
